# Matlab apertus AXIOM Beta helpers
Matlab helper toolset to control the apertus AXIOM raw capture tools on camera and helpers to evaluate and process those images.

This framework was mostly created for my own use while working on an early AXIOM Beta for my Bachelor thesis. It was developed without error handling in most and for my use only but I decided to publish people interested to get some ideas.


## Warning
The code isn't well written and was build on a per need basis, without a proper preplanned structure. It was intended to ease the work on my thesis using Matlab that I like for such tasks due to its interactive command interface. Other than that I wouldn't use Matlab as I don't like it's syntax and structure at all.

Debayering algorithms were written when I started with Matlab and became my playing ground. Therefore different styles to store data were tried.


## Note
By default image data is expanded to fit the fixed bayer pattern structure expected by the algorithms.


## Usage
To be done if enough interest will be present.
